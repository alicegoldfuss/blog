2021 was quite the year, in that I had my first professional fiction sale! That story is eligible for the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and World Fantasy Award, among others, and is on the [Nebula Recommended Reading list](https://www.sfwa.org/forum/reading/work/5364-the-woman-with-no-face/){:target="_blank"}.

And, since this is my first pro-market publication, I am eligible for the [Astounding Award for Best New Writer](https://astoundingaward.info/){:target="_blank"}.

_I was blown away by this story in Fantasy Magazine. It's so rich, intense, and trippy, and I love the grit and detail of it. We are in a world where some people can connect their minds to each other, an ability they explore and hone as a community in rituals when you reach a certain age. But when Ankuin is old enough to undergo the ritual, something goes terribly wrong and afterwards, her own community doesn't know what to do with her. When invaders attack the community years later, Ankuin's singular ability helps her lead a resistance, but even then, she's shunned and feared by many. This story packs a powerful emotional punch on so many levels._

I would be thrilled if you checked it out, and I appreciate your consideration this upcoming award season.
