2018, the year that felt like ten. Time hopped and jogged and stood still, twisted me all around, chewed me up and spat me out with every horrible update of the news cycle.

<!-- more -->

Still, this year wasn‚Äôt all bad! I gave [my first keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJx_emIiABk){:target="_blank"}, saw some of [my code open-sourced](https://githubengineering.com/glb-director-open-source-load-balancer/){:target="_blank"}, and attended a Frida Kahlo exhibit at the V&A. I started my year with istio and kernel crashes, progressed to large Kubernetes cluster operations, and finished by starting a new perf project. I traveled, gardened, donated, baked, wrote, danced, built a CPU out of logic gates for funzies, and sipped tea. I ended up on [this weird HuffPost list](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/50-funniest-tweets-from-women-2018_us_5c195b7be4b08db990588964){:target="_blank"}. And, oh yeah, I went through a [teensy acquisition](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/){:target="_blank"}.

In my [2017 review post](http://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/2017-year-in-review/){:target="_blank"}, I said I wanted to do more lower level systems work, technical talks, and leisure reading. I‚Äôve done that. For 2019, I‚Äôd like to find a balance between sharing my excitement over learning new things and broadcasting my already-considerable technical knowledge. I‚Äôm very bad at self-advertisement.

And now, some lists.
